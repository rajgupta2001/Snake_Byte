# Snake_Byte
This is a simple game 2000's kids used to play in old mobile phones.

Project(Game) - SNAKE BYTE
Created using Java Swing.
I've always wanted to recreate this old childhood game we used to play
in our old mobile phones. In game, snake eats food and grows in length.
Game will be over when snake overlaps its own body.
